# unity-lightFlickeringSystem-dots-hdrp

WIP

A light flickering system using DOTS. This system allows you to make dynamic and controllable "flickers" for your lights.
It can be used to animate lights through code.

Some of the following presets are available, but options are endless!
- Alert
- Ambient
- Spooky
- Off

This system is dependent on the following packages:
com.unity.entities
com.unity.physics
com.unity.render-pipelines.high-definition

This system currently uses Odin Inspector & Serializer for its editors.
